# NotJanselLive
This Minecraft Datapack is for Servers which don't really allow streaming, maybe because of nametag visibility. That's why I made this Datapack with a friend of mine and the functionalities are as following:
- /trigger live - this trigger adds a player to the live team, which has its nametag visible to everyone, but nametags from people who arent in the live team are hidden for people in the live.
- /trigger offline - this trigger adds a player to the offline team when he goes offline from streaming (A player which is joining is automatically added to the offline team)
- /trigger credits - Credits to me and my friend.
- /trigger agreed - This is for people who are comfortable with being recorded. (also their nametag gets shown to live people.
- /trigger recording - Shows that you are recording. Basically the same as live but, yeah, recording.

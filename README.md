# NotJanselLive
This Minecraft Datapack is for Servers, which don't really allow streaming, because of maybe nametag visibility. That's why I mad with a friend of mine this Datapack and the functionalities are as following:

- /trigger live - this trigger set a player to the live team, which has its nametag visible to everyone, but nametags from people, who arent in the live team, are hidden.
- /trigger offline - this trigger sets a player into the offline, when he goes offline from streaming (A player which is joining is automatically set to the offline team)
- /trigger credits - Credits to me and my friend.

# Information
The teams for this datapack are automatically made with enabling. Please note, that unattended modification without knowledge may cause the datapack to break.
